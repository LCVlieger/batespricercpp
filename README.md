# `batespricer`

Option pricer and calibrator under the Bates stochastic volatility model. Calibrates to live market data, prices vanillas and path-dependent exotics, and computes Greeks.

The Bates model extends Heston by adding Merton log-normal jumps to the asset price process. This captures both the volatility smile at shorter maturities and the skew at longer maturities. For a detailed description of the methodology and results, see the [report](batespricer.pdf).

## Pricing and calibration

Two pricing approaches are implemented. A semi-analytical direct integration method uses the Albrecher (2007) formulation with Gauss-Legendre quadrature and maturity-based caching. A Monte Carlo simulation uses full truncation (Lord et al., 2010) and quadratic exponential (Andersen, 2008) discretization schemes. Calibration is formulated as spread-weighted nonlinear least squares, solved with L-BFGS-B and SLSQP. The accelerated semi-analytical calibration converges in under 10 seconds. Calibrated to 300 OTM options per asset, the semi-analytical approach achieves a price RMSE of 4.84 bps for the S&P 500 and 6.28 bps for Apple.

The calibrated parameters are applied to exotic options. Results under the Bates model for the S&P 500 and Apple (T = 1, K = 1.05 · S₀, B = 0.8 · S₀):

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LCVlieger/batespricer
cd batespricer
pip install -e .
```

**Calibrate to market data:**
```bash
python examples/1a_market_calibration_Ana_naive.py
python examples/1b_market_calibration_Ana_accelerated.py
python examples/1c_market_calibration_MC_naive.py
python examples/1d_market_calibration_MC_accelerated.py
```

**Price exotics under calibrated parameters:**
```bash
python examples/2_exotic_pricing.py
```

## Tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

Validates European call convergence to Black-Scholes, Asian call convergence to Turnbull-Wakeman, and put-call parity.
